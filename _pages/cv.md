Hello! I'm a rising junior and returning boarding student at New England Innovation Academy. I'm a strong believer in leveraging rapidly advancing technologies to create a better world. Let's collaborate to achieve something great together.

# Experience
Where I've worked and what I've done there.
## Research @ Massachusetts Institute of Technology | 2023 - Current
During my time at MIT, I am working within the confluence of Artificial Intelligences and the City Sciences. More specifically, my work is geared towards making data accessible to the average citizen.
- Spearheaded the creation of SQLLM, a bandwidth efficient, adaptable architecture that allowed LLMs to securely interact with databases without forfeiting more information than required.
- I also lead the creation of CityGPT, an application of the SQLLM architecture aiming to make real-time youBike information and insights accessible to everybody. I am currently working with Foxconn to see how we can get this into the hands of the average citizen.
- Currently working on the development of uSim, an urban simulation and planning application that combines the synthesis of qualitative and quantitative data for human-centered-planning.

## Artificial Intelligence Intern @ Red Peak | 2023 - Current
At Red Peak, I currently work predominantly on the creation of an internal suite of tools to effectively and efficiently speed up internal processes.
- Created automatic, brand-conscious social media post generation system for LinkedIn and Instagram, with more coming soon.
- Invented a unique methodology to represent structured and unstructured data using large language models and ChartJS interfacing.
- Building an aggregated application for these projects, alongside top-secret projects for our most security conscious clients.

## Systems Design Intern @ StandOut | 2023 - Current
At StandoutSearch, I work to design artificial intelligence systems to speed up company workflows. 
- I built ASC (Automated Student/Company) Matcher with the goal of connecting students with companies. I had previously built a piece of software to match a cohort of over 150+ students with 100+ companies, resulting in over 300,000$ of revenue for StandOut Search.
- I also built a tool for increasing database inputs by up to 1000% efficiency. The tool takes web links, extracts raw text data, and outputs all necessary information for the database. The database has a newsletter with over 1000 readers and 1000s of weekly student impressions.

## Chief Design Officer @ NEIA // School Store | 2022 - Current
As the Chief Design Officer of the New England Innovation Academy school store, I was responsible for (but not limited to) the following;
- Design, creation, and maintenance of neiastore.com (NEIA School Store official website) which has achieved over 15,000$ in revenue.
- I was also responsible for the creation/solution of payment processing within the website, working with administration to identify feasible solutions. Payment processing solution was then used during the 2023 NEIA Gala.
- As CDO, I was also in charge of the design of all of our current items. I worked closely with the CMO and COO, alongside administration to identify feasible clothing design solutions and ideal garment choices.

# Projects

### SQLLM - Touchless, secure LLM-DB interaction.

- Designed and implemented an innovative system to enhance Human-Database interaction.
- Developed an adaptable architecture, SQLLM, facilitating secure interactions between LLMs and databases while minimizing data exposure.
- Addressed issues of cost, speed, and accuracy associated with existing database interaction methods.
- Executed during the summer of 2023 at the CSL Lab; actively collaborating with Foxconn for implementation within the youBike system.

### CityGPT - Vital transport insights for all.

- Created a software solution to democratize access to crucial transportation information.
- Constructed CityGPT using the SQLLM architecture to enable real-time youBike insights for all users.
- Addressed user dissatisfaction with existing clunky and non-intuitive transportation data platforms.
- Developed during the summer of 2023 at the CSL Lab; ongoing collaboration with Foxconn for wider application.

### realagents - High fidelity human models for ABM | WIP

- Pioneered a project aimed at generating highly realistic digital individuals.
- Established a model architecture allowing constant-time propagation of statistically accurate "digital twin" agents within complex ecosystems.
- Derived from a cross-disciplinary approach, leveraging aspects of AI and human behavior simulation.
- Launched during the summer of 2023 at the CSL Lab; continued development in collaboration with MIT in the United States.

### uSim - Qualitative & quantitative city-sims | WIP

- Working on the development of uSim, an ambitious urban simulation system prioritizing human-centric factors.
- Fusing qualitative and quantitative dataflows, empowered by LLMs, to create a scalable urban simulation model.
- Addressing the limitations of conventional urban simulation methodologies by emphasizing the human experience.
- Launched during the summer of 2023 at the CSL Lab; continued development in collaboration with MIT in the United States.

### An Empathetic Approach To Urban Design

- Authored AEA2UD, a research paper proposing a unique human-centered-design framework for urban planning.
- Currently working to get it published.

### TeaRoute
- TeaRoute is a project that I built to make text classification accessible to all.
- TeaRoute is a recursively improving, trainable, cheap (1,000,000 Classifications per 1$), and easy to seat up (< 200 Characters) system for text classification available anywhere.
- Previously, similar systems I had made for each project took days to develop. With my system, it took minutes.
